## Usage Instructions

### Local Development
```powershell
# Build the solution
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Configuration Release

# Run all tests with coverage
.\scripts\run-tests.ps1 -TestType All -Coverage

# Build Docker image
.\scripts\docker-build.ps1 -Tag latest -Push
```

### Deployment
```powershell
# Deploy to staging
.\deployment\deploy.ps1 -Environment staging -Tag latest

# Deploy to production
.\deployment\deploy.ps1 -Environment production -Tag v1.0.0
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automatic**: Pipeline triggers on push to main/develop branches
- **Manual**: Can be triggered manually for specific branches
- **Release**: Production deployment on GitHub releases

## Files Created

### Scripts
- `scripts/build.ps1` - PowerShell build script
- `scripts/build.sh` - Bash build script  
- `scripts/run-tests.ps1` - PowerShell test automation
- `scripts/run-tests.sh` - Bash test automation
- `scripts/docker-build.ps1` - Docker build automation

### Deployment
- `deployment/docker-compose.production.yml` - Production Docker Compose
- `deployment/.env.staging` - Staging environment template
- `deployment/.env.production` - Production environment template
- `deployment/deploy.ps1` - Deployment automation script
